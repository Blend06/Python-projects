The "F" at the end of the pdf.output("yourfile.pdf", "F") line is a destination flag that tells the FPDF library where to send the generated PDF file.

In this case, the "F" flag stands for "File", which means the PDF file will be saved to a file on the local file system. The file path and name are specified by the first argument to the output() method, which is "yourfile.pdf".

Here are the possible destination flags that can be used with the output() method:

"I" : Send the PDF file to the standard output (usually the browser)
"D" : Send the PDF file to the browser and force a file download
"F" : Save the PDF file to a file on the local file system
"S" : Return the PDF file as a string
So, in this specific case, the "F" flag is used to save the generated PDF file to a file named "yourfile.pdf" on the local file system.
